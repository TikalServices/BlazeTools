This is the source code for a small utility bot for TIKAL'S PALACE. This source code is perfect if you wish to make your own private bot that displays your social media pages or see what my utility bot is like.
Has userinfo command and say command as well.

SETUP
1. Download or Fork this Source code
2. Create your Discord bot application at discord.com/developers (Make sure to copy your bot token. You will need this). Also make sure to enable the Message content intent
3. At client.run("YOURBOTTOKEN") which is located at the bottom, replace YOURBOTTOKEN with your own Discord bot token.
4. At client = commands.Bot(command_prefix = 'b!'), replace b! with the prefix you want to use.
5. Run the Bot.

Same process happens with the mainrevolt.py file.
